# Triangle Task
This repository contains my solution to the Triangle Task, a common coding challenge encountered during QA Automation job interviews. The task involves testing a function that determines the type of a triangle based on its side lengths.

## Task Description
The task is to write test cases for a function that takes three integer arguments representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle and returns the type of triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene). Additionally, the function should handle invalid inputs and return an error message or code.

## Solution
In this repository, you will find my solution to the Triangle Task. The tests cover various scenarios, including valid triangles, invalid inputs, and edge cases.
